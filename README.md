Group playlist creation app

Group Music is a web application I created to allow collaboration on Spotify playlists. 

Users are able to add a set amount of songs to a playlist, which is created and updated on spotify.

Group Music is also entirely web based, so in theory nothing would need to be downloaded to use.

It also has the option to toggle between a light and dark theme, and will remember a users preference.
